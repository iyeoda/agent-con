### App Framework UI Design Overview

1. **Sidebar**
   - A vertical sidebar with icons for "Dashboard," "Data," "AI Agents," and "Settings."
   - Icons are displayed with tooltips that reveal the name of each section when hovered.
   - Sidebar expands on hover to reveal text labels next to the icons.

2. **Top Bar**
   - Contains the app logo and the active project name ("Woodside").
   - A search button (with an orange icon) opens a modal to handle complex queries.
   - The modal provides a text area for multi-line input and filter options for the search.

3. **Search Modal**
   - Triggered when the search button is clicked.
   - Includes an input field for the search query and options to filter by categories such as Projects, Documents, AI Agents, etc.
   - The modal is styled to match the overall app, with no background dimming.
   - Results are grouped into categories: Documents, Tasks, and Projects, each with links for more details.

4. **Styling**
   - The color scheme includes shades of indigo, orange, and mint.
   - Elements are spaced neatly and are responsive.
   - The overall aesthetic is modern, clean, and professional with a touch of creativity (e.g., the use of orange for key buttons and accents).
